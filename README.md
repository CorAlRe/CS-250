# CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle

* How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I interpret user needs through three areas, who is acting, what are they trying to do, and why is this valuable to the user and/or organization.

* How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Development is a process and like any process there are procedures to follow in order to organize and ensure work is done well and to everyone's satisfaction. I will be incorporating the Scrum model in much of my work, inluding user stories, the daily scrum, and reviews and retrospectives. 

* What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To show myself accountable to the team and take ownership for the area I am responsible for.
